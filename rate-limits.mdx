title: 'Rate Limits'
description: 'To ensure service stability and fair usage, POW Cards implements rate limiting on API endpoints.'

## Limits by Endpoint

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Window |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `GET /claim/init` | 100 requests | 15 minutes |
| `POST /claim/wallet-pass` | 100 requests | 15 minutes |

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code: 
```json Response
{
"error": "Too many requests",
"details": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in X minutes"
}
```

## Best Practices

To avoid hitting rate limits:

- Perform signatures and network requests on the client-side if possible
- Implement exponential backoff for retries


## Enterprise Limits
